# Terms of Use
Please read these Terms of Use (“Terms”) carefully before using the Five Stars application (the “Application” or “Five Stars”) created by Mathias Emil Mortensen (the “Developer”, “us”, or “we”).

By accessing and using Five Stars, you (“User”) acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and those set forth in the [Privacy Policy](https://getfivestars.app/privacypolicy/). If you disagree with any part of the Terms and the Privacy Policy, you are not authorised to use the Application.

We may modify these Terms and the Privacy Policy at any time and such modification will be effective upon posting to the Application.

## Subscriptions
If you choose to buy an Five Stars Pro subscription, payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase. The subscription automatically renews unless it is canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your account settings on the App Store after purchase.

The Developer may modify or remove features of the subscription at any time, with or without notice. Specifically, the Developer may change data providers at any time. You agree that the Developer will bear no liability to you or any third party in such event.

All purchases are final. The Developer cannot issue refunds for purchases charged to your Apple ID. The Developer, at its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees in accordance with Apple’s policies.
